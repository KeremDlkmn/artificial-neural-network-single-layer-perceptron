# Artificial Neural Network Single Layer Perceptron

It is the first of **ANN**(**A**rtificial **N**eural **N**etwork) models. Rosenblat, in 1958
pattern has been developed for classification purposes, later it became the basis of **ANN** models. **SLP**(**S**ingle **L**ayer **P**erceptron) consists of input and output layers only. One for each network or has more inputs(**X**) and one output(**O**). The output value depends on the input values. Each link has a weight(**W**). The photo below is an example of **SLP**<br />

**inputs:** They are data from the outside world.<br />
**weights:** Shows the importance of the information entered in an artificial cell and its effect on the cell.<br />
**sum:** Calculates **NET** entry in a cell.The photo below is an example of **sum**<br />

**activation functions:** It determines the output corresponding to the input of the cell by processing the value of the **NET** input into the cell. The photo below is an example of **activation functions**
